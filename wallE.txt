All racing into the valley over the contour of the terrain.
Triangulating towards a center.

Slowly he reaches for it.
Can't grab it.

Bangs his head on metal.
WIDE on a massive SPACESHIP.
Rests ominously in the empty bay.

Wall-E is transfixed.
Inches closer.

Tilts his head.
Time stops.
She's the most beautiful thing he's ever seen.
Eve hovers over the ground.
A BLUE RAY emits from her front panel.
Fans out 180 degrees.
Scans random objects and areas.
The device rises back into the ship.
Exposes Wall-E.
He rushes for cover behind the nearest rock.
Never takes his eyes off Eve.
Watches her float away from the ship.
...from the ship? The ship! Engines roar back to life.
Wall-E digging furiously.
The rocket takes off.
Smoke clears.
Again, a red hot Wall-E peeks out from the ground.
Looks for Eve.
She is watching the ship rise into the clouds.
Waits until it is completely out of sight...
...then Eve rises high up into the air.
She flies around the bay.
Soars like a graceful bird.
Does loops in the sky.
Zooms right past Wall-E's rock.
He is hypnotized.
Eve descends gently to the ground...
Wall-E sneaks up closer.
Hides behind another boulder.
Slips.

Unscathed.
Still curious.
Eve finds the insect intriguing.
Lowers her arm.
The end separates into individual hovering sections...
...A HAND.
She lets the insect crawl up her arm.
Wiggles into her workings.
It tickles.

Keeps her gun trained on him.
EVE (electronic hums) [Repeat.
Identify yourself.] Wall-E peeks out from his box.
Doesn't understand a thing she says.
Doesn't care.
Can't believe she's real.
The cockroach climbs down her gun arm.
Jumps onto his master.
Eve scans Wall-E.
A RED LIGHT appears on her chest.
Buzzes "negative".
He's not what she's looking for.
She retracts her gun arm.

Gets stuck.
Wrestles to free herself.
Furious, she BLOWS UP THE ENTIRE SHIP.
The reaction startles Wall-E.
Eve slumps down against a dredged anchor.
She gives up.
Concerned, Wall-E cautiously approaches.
Sits at the other end of the anchor.
Both robots stare silently at the fiery wreck.
Then...
...slowly, very slowly, Wall-E inches towards her.
Musters the courage to speak, when -- She suddenly turns to him: EVE (hums) [So what's your story?] Wall-E falls backwards with surprise.
Me? Eve scrolls through a variety of languages: EVE (German) [Directive?] (Japanese) [Directive?] WALL-E [Huh?] EVE (Swahili) [Directive?] (English) Directive? WALL-E (beeps) [Oh, I understand that!] 14.

Wall-E nearly melts.
She says his name so beautifully.
Moves closer.

Wall-E tries to repeat it: WALL-E Eeee...? EVE (slower) Eve.
15.
WALL-E Eeeaaah? EVE Eeeve.
Eeeve.
WALL-E Eee--vah! She giggles again.
Wall-E likes making her giggle.
WALL-E Eee-vah! Ee -- EVE Eve.

He moves to grab her.
WALL-E (Gasp!) Eee-vah! EVE (hums) [Hey watch it! Don't come any closer!] She draws her gun on him.
Doesn't understand the danger.
The sandstorm rushes up behind her.
Too late.
Wall-E collapses into a box.
The storm hits full force.
Eve is instantly lost, disoriented.

An air of enchantment.
Eve is taken aback.
WALL-E (beeps) [Come on in.] She drifts through the sea of knickknacks.
Becomes spooked by a SINGING BILLY BASS FISH.
Threatens to shoot it, but Wall-E calms her down.
He is compelled to show her everything.
Hands her an eggbeater...
...bubble wrap (so infectious to pop)...
...a lightbulb (lights when she holds it)...
...the Rubik's Cube (she solves it immediately)...
...his Hello Dolly tape.
Curious, she begins unspooling the tape.
WALL-E (loud beeps) [My tape!!] He grabs it back.

...a SMALL PLANT in its early stage of growth.
Wall-E is entranced.
Carefully, he extracts the section of earth around it.
CLOSE ON IGLOO COOLER Wall-E gently places the plant inside the old boot.
Dusts dirt off the leaves.
EXT.
TRUCK - DUSK Robot and faithful cockroach return home.
Wall-E stops short of the threshold.
Stares at the ground.
Continues staring.
A RED DOT quivers on the dirt.
A single laser point of light.
Wall-E moves to touch it...
...The dot races along the ground.
Wall-E drops his Igloo.
Chases after the dot.
EXT.
EMPTY BAY The dot leads Wall-E deep into the polluted expanse.
He is so fixated on it he doesn't notice MANY LASER POINTS coming from every direction.
All racing into the valley over the contour of the terrain.
Triangulating towards a center.
Wall-E's dot suddenly stops.
Slowly he reaches for it.
Can't grab it.
Just light.
ALL THE DOTS converge in front of him.
The ground shakes.
Wall-E becomes confused.
Doesn't see above him.
The SUN growing brighter behind the cloud cover.
A noise.
Building.

Rocket engines.
Wall-E senses he should look to the sky.
Now THREE SUNS are descending on him.
Wall-E runs for it.
An enormous COLUMN OF FIRE blocks his path.
A second column of fire.
A third.
Trapped.
Wall-E cubes the ground beneath him.
Working fast.
Noise deafening.
Heat rising.
Digs in just as a tide of flame carpets the ground...
...Then suddenly quiet.
Smoke clears.
CLOSE ON THE SCORCHED EARTH Wall-E's head rises out of the dirt.
Glows red hot from the heat.
Trembles with fright.
Everything in shadow.
Something very big looms over him.
Wall-E climbs out of his hole.
Bangs his head on metal.
WIDE on a massive SPACESHIP.
Rests ominously in the empty bay.
A PORTAL on its underside opens.
Frightened, Wall-E tries to hide.
Nowhere to go.
He places a SMALL ROCK on his head.
Boxes up.
A DEVICE lowers to the ground on a long stem.
Scans the surface.
Wall-E creeps closer for a better look.
The device unfolds.
Wall-E boxes up again.
A CAPSULE descends from a chute in the stem.
ROBOT ARMS emerge from the device.
Place the capsule on the ground.
Press buttons.
The capsule falls away in sections, to reveal...

Blue-lit eyes.
Female.
Eve.
Wall-E is transfixed.
Inches closer.
Watches Eve from behind the device.
Tilts his head.
Time stops.
She's the most beautiful thing he's ever seen.
Eve hovers over the ground.
A BLUE RAY emits from her front panel.
Fans out 180 degrees.
Scans random objects and areas.
The device rises back into the ship.
Exposes Wall-E.
He rushes for cover behind the nearest rock.
Never takes his eyes off Eve.
Watches her float away from the ship.
...from the ship? The ship! Engines roar back to life.
Wall-E digging furiously.
The rocket takes off.
Smoke clears.
Again, a red hot Wall-E peeks out from the ground.
Looks for Eve.
She is watching the ship rise into the clouds.
Waits until it is completely out of sight...
...then Eve rises high up into the air.
She flies around the bay.
Soars like a graceful bird.
Does loops in the sky.
Zooms right past Wall-E's rock.
He is hypnotized.
Eve descends gently to the ground...
Wall-E sneaks up closer.
Hides behind another boulder.
Slips.
Makes a NOISE.
Instantly, Eve whips around.
Her arm converts into a LASER CANNON.
Blasts Wall-E's boulder to smithereens.
...Smoke clears...All quiet.
Eve, now cold and dangerous.

Wall-E hiding nearby.
He flinches at the sight of HIS COCKROACH innocently approaching Eve from behind.
She spins around.
Blasts the insect.
Wall-E is gut-punched.
The cockroach climbs out of the smoking crater.
Unscathed.
Still curious.
Eve finds the insect intriguing.
Lowers her arm.
The end separates into individual hovering sections...
...A HAND.
She lets the insect crawl up her arm.
Wiggles into her workings.
It tickles.
EVE [Giggles] Wall-E relaxes.
CHUCKLES privately.
Eve sonically picks up Wall-E's location.
Locks onto him.

EVE (electronic hums) [Identify yourself.] She slowly approaches Wall-E's box.
Keeps her gun trained on him.
EVE (electronic hums) [Repeat.
Identify yourself.] Wall-E peeks out from his box.
Doesn't understand a thing she says.
Doesn't care.
Can't believe she's real.
The cockroach climbs down her gun arm.
Jumps onto his master.
Eve scans Wall-E.
A RED LIGHT appears on her chest.
Buzzes "negative".
He's not what she's looking for.
She retracts her gun arm.
Hovers off.
Wall-E watches her go.
Lovestruck.

Accidentally trips.
Tumbles to the ground.
Eve doesn't wake.
Wall-E creeps up to her.
Opens his arms wide...
...and measures her.
Turns to a pile of trash.
Splits open his eyes.
Begins welding something...
DISSOLVE TO: EXT.

Wall-E eavesdrops from afar.
Eve flies past the ship's CRANE MAGNET.
Gets stuck.
Wrestles to free herself.
Furious, she BLOWS UP THE ENTIRE SHIP.
The reaction startles Wall-E.
Eve slumps down against a dredged anchor.
She gives up.
Concerned, Wall-E cautiously approaches.
Sits at the other end of the anchor.
Both robots stare silently at the fiery wreck.
Then...
...slowly, very slowly, Wall-E inches towards her.
Musters the courage to speak, when -- She suddenly turns to him: EVE (hums) [So what's your story?] Wall-E falls backwards with surprise.
Me? Eve scrolls through a variety of languages: EVE (German) [Directive?] (Japanese) [Directive?] WALL-E [Huh?] EVE (Swahili) [Directive?] (English) Directive? WALL-E (beeps) [Oh, I understand that!] 14.
EVE Directive? Wall-E eagerly turns to some nearby trash.
Scoops it into his compactor.
Proudly spits out a cube.
Points to Eve.

WALL-E (beeps) [Oh.
Sorry.] She scans his CHEST LOGO.
EVE Name? WALL-E (struggles again) W-wally? ...Wall-E.
EVE (smooth; almost perfect) Wwww-aaaa-leee...
Wall-E nearly melts.
She says his name so beautifully.
Moves closer.
EVE Wall-E.

Wall-E tries to repeat it: WALL-E Eeee...? EVE (slower) Eve.
15.
WALL-E Eeeaaah? EVE Eeeve.
Eeeve.
WALL-E Eee--vah! She giggles again.
Wall-E likes making her giggle.
WALL-E Eee-vah! Ee -- EVE Eve.
The wind kicks up.
The WARNING LIGHT sounds on Wall-E's chest.
He moves to grab her.
WALL-E (Gasp!) Eee-vah! EVE (hums) [Hey watch it! Don't come any closer!] She draws her gun on him.
Doesn't understand the danger.
The sandstorm rushes up behind her.
Too late.
Wall-E collapses into a box.
The storm hits full force.
Eve is instantly lost, disoriented.
EVE Wall-E? Wall-E? WALL-E'S HAND appears out of the dust.
Calmly takes Eve's hand.
INT.

A rush of wind and sand.
Wall-E pulls Eve inside.
Closes the door.
She coughs up dust.
Wall-E hits a switch...
Strings of CHRISTMAS LIGHTS fill the space.
His racks of oddities painted in colored light.
16.
An air of enchantment.
Eve is taken aback.
WALL-E (beeps) [Come on in.] She drifts through the sea of knickknacks.
Becomes spooked by a SINGING BILLY BASS FISH.
Threatens to shoot it, but Wall-E calms her down.
He is compelled to show her everything.
Hands her an eggbeater...
...bubble wrap (so infectious to pop)...
...a lightbulb (lights when she holds it)...
...the Rubik's Cube (she solves it immediately)...
...his Hello Dolly tape.
Curious, she begins unspooling the tape.
WALL-E (loud beeps) [My tape!!] He grabs it back.
Protective.
Inserts it carefully into the VCR.
Please still work.
The movie eventually appears on the TV.
Plays a clip of POYSC.
Wall-E is relieved.
EXT.
SPACE FADE IN: Stars.
The upbeat show tune, Put On Your Sunday Clothes, plays.
"Out there, there's a world outside of Yonkers..." More stars.

A single planet.
Drab and brown.
Moving towards it.
Pushing through its polluted atmosphere.
"...Close your eyes and see it glisten..." EXT.
PLANET'S SURFACE - CONTINUOUS A range of mountains takes form in the haze.
Moving closer.
The mountains are piles of TRASH.
The entire surface is nothing but waste.
"...We're gonna find adventure in the evening air..." A silhouetted city in the distance.
What looks like skyscrapers turns into trash.
Thousands of neatly stacked CUBES OF TRASH, stories high.
Rows and rows of stacked cubes, like city avenues.
They go on for miles.

Mini-shovel hands collect junk.
Scoop it into his open chassis.
His front plate closes slowly, compressing waste.
A faded label on his corroded chest plate: "Waste Allocation Loader - Earth Class" (WALL-E) Wall-E spits out a cube of trash.
Stacks it with the others.
2.
Something catches his eye.
Tugs on a piece of metal stuck in the stack.
A hubcap.
The sun reflects off it.
Wall-E checks the sky.
ON TRASH HEAP HORIZON The sun sets through the smoggy haze.
"...And we won't come back until we've kissed a girl --" He places the hubcap in his compactor.
Presses a button on his chest.
The song stops playing.
The end of a work day.
Wall-E attaches a lunch cooler to his back.
Whistles for his pet COCKROACH.
The insect hops on his shoulder.
They motor down from the top of a GIANT TRASH TOWER.
EXT.
AVENUES OF TRASH - DUSK Wall-E travels alone.
Traverses miles of desolate waste.
Oblivious to roving storms of toxic weather.
Passes haunting structures buried within the trash.
Buildings, highways, entire cities...
Everything branded with the SAME COMPANY LOGO.
"Buy N Large" "BNL" stores, restaurants, banks...transportation! The corporation ran every aspect of life.
There's even a BNL LOGO on Wall-E's chest plate.
CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER Wall-E drives over.
Headline: "TOO MUCH TRASH!! Earth Covered!!" The deck: "BNL CEO Declares Global Emergency!" A photo of the BNL CEO giving a weak smile.

Reveals the AXIOM'S DESERTED LAUNCHPAD in the distance.
The mammoth structure sits across the bay.
Now empty and dry.
A polluted, dead valley.

Jury-rigged to an iPod.
Pushes in a cassette labeled, "Hello Dolly!" The image is very poor quality.
Actors sing and dance to Put On Your Sunday Clothes (POYSC).
The same song Wall-E worked to.
WALL-E [Hums POYSC] Wall-E opens his cooler.
Newfound knickknacks.
Pulls out the hubcap from his chest.
Looks back at the TV.
Mimics the dancers on the screen.
Pretends the hubcap is a hat.
Continues to unpack: A spork.
A Rubik's Cube (unsolved).
A Zippo Lighter.
He presses a BUTTON by the rack of shelves.
They rotate until an empty space appears.
His new items are lovingly added to the shelf.
The Zippo joins a pre-existing LIGHTER COLLECTION.
A new song, It Only Takes A Moment, plays on the video.
Wall-E is drawn to it.
Presses his "Record" button.

No biggie.
Ready to go.
Relieved, Wall-E resumes their commute.

Fans out 180 degrees.
Scans random objects and areas.

Exposes Wall-E.
He rushes for cover behind the nearest rock.
Never takes his eyes off Eve.
Watches her float away from the ship.

Wall-E digging furiously.
The rocket takes off.
Smoke clears.
Again, a red hot Wall-E peeks out from the ground.
Looks for Eve.
She is watching the ship rise into the clouds.
Waits until it is completely out of sight...

She flies around the bay.
Soars like a graceful bird.
Does loops in the sky.
Zooms right past Wall-E's rock.

Eve descends gently to the ground...
Wall-E sneaks up closer.
Hides behind another boulder.

Unscathed.
Still curious.
Eve finds the insect intriguing.
Lowers her arm.
The end separates into individual hovering sections...

She lets the insect crawl up her arm.
Wiggles into her workings.

Keeps her gun trained on him.
EVE (electronic hums) [Repeat.
Identify yourself.] Wall-E peeks out from his box.
Doesn't understand a thing she says.
Doesn't care.
Can't believe she's real.
The cockroach climbs down her gun arm.
Jumps onto his master.
Eve scans Wall-E.
A RED LIGHT appears on her chest.
Buzzes "negative".
He's not what she's looking for.

Wrestles to free herself.
Furious, she BLOWS UP THE ENTIRE SHIP.
The reaction startles Wall-E.
Eve slumps down against a dredged anchor.
She gives up.
Concerned, Wall-E cautiously approaches.
Sits at the other end of the anchor.
Both robots stare silently at the fiery wreck.
Then...

Musters the courage to speak, when -- She suddenly turns to him: EVE (hums) [So what's your story?] Wall-E falls backwards with surprise.

Wall-E moves to touch it...
...The dot races along the ground.
Wall-E drops his Igloo.
Chases after the dot.
EXT.
EMPTY BAY The dot leads Wall-E deep into the polluted expanse.
He is so fixated on it he doesn't notice MANY LASER POINTS coming from every direction.
All racing into the valley over the contour of the terrain.
Triangulating towards a center.
Wall-E's dot suddenly stops.
Slowly he reaches for it.
Can't grab it.
Just light.
ALL THE DOTS converge in front of him.
The ground shakes.
Wall-E becomes confused.
Doesn't see above him.
The SUN growing brighter behind the cloud cover.
A noise.

Glows red hot from the heat.
Trembles with fright.
Everything in shadow.
Something very big looms over him.
Wall-E climbs out of his hole.
Bangs his head on metal.
WIDE on a massive SPACESHIP.
Rests ominously in the empty bay.
A PORTAL on its underside opens.
Frightened, Wall-E tries to hide.
Nowhere to go.
He places a SMALL ROCK on his head.
Boxes up.

Scans the surface.
Wall-E creeps closer for a better look.
The device unfolds.
Wall-E boxes up again.
A CAPSULE descends from a chute in the stem.

A BLUE RAY emits from her front panel.
Fans out 180 degrees.
Scans random objects and areas.
The device rises back into the ship.
Exposes Wall-E.
He rushes for cover behind the nearest rock.
Never takes his eyes off Eve.
Watches her float away from the ship.
...from the ship? The ship! Engines roar back to life.
Wall-E digging furiously.
The rocket takes off.
Smoke clears.
Again, a red hot Wall-E peeks out from the ground.
Looks for Eve.
She is watching the ship rise into the clouds.
Waits until it is completely out of sight...
...then Eve rises high up into the air.
She flies around the bay.
Soars like a graceful bird.
Does loops in the sky.
Zooms right past Wall-E's rock.
He is hypnotized.
Eve descends gently to the ground...
Wall-E sneaks up closer.
Hides behind another boulder.
Slips.

He flinches at the sight of HIS COCKROACH innocently approaching Eve from behind.
She spins around.
Blasts the insect.
Wall-E is gut-punched.
The cockroach climbs out of the smoking crater.
Unscathed.
Still curious.
Eve finds the insect intriguing.
Lowers her arm.
The end separates into individual hovering sections...
...A HAND.
She lets the insect crawl up her arm.
Wiggles into her workings.
It tickles.
EVE [Giggles] Wall-E relaxes.
CHUCKLES privately.

Keeps her gun trained on him.
EVE (electronic hums) [Repeat.
Identify yourself.] Wall-E peeks out from his box.
Doesn't understand a thing she says.
Doesn't care.
Can't believe she's real.
The cockroach climbs down her gun arm.
Jumps onto his master.
Eve scans Wall-E.
A RED LIGHT appears on her chest.
Buzzes "negative".
He's not what she's looking for.
She retracts her gun arm.

Opens his arms wide...
...and measures her.
Turns to a pile of trash.
Splits open his eyes.
Begins welding something...
DISSOLVE TO: EXT.

Does a double take.
A TRASH SCULPTURE OF EVE stands in front of her.

Not finding what she's looking for.
Wall-E eavesdrops from afar.
Eve flies past the ship's CRANE MAGNET.
Gets stuck.
Wrestles to free herself.
Furious, she BLOWS UP THE ENTIRE SHIP.
The reaction startles Wall-E.
Eve slumps down against a dredged anchor.
She gives up.
Concerned, Wall-E cautiously approaches.
Sits at the other end of the anchor.
Both robots stare silently at the fiery wreck.
Then...
...slowly, very slowly, Wall-E inches towards her.
Musters the courage to speak, when -- She suddenly turns to him: EVE (hums) [So what's your story?] Wall-E falls backwards with surprise.
Me? Eve scrolls through a variety of languages: EVE (German) [Directive?] (Japanese) [Directive?] WALL-E [Huh?] EVE (Swahili) [Directive?] (English) Directive? WALL-E (beeps) [Oh, I understand that!] 14.
EVE Directive? Wall-E eagerly turns to some nearby trash.
Scoops it into his compactor.
Proudly spits out a cube.
Points to Eve.
WALL-E (struggles to speak) Di...rec...t-- EVE Directive? Wall-E nods.
EVE Classified.
WALL-E (beeps) [Oh.
Sorry.] She scans his CHEST LOGO.
EVE Name? WALL-E (struggles again) W-wally? ...Wall-E.
EVE (smooth; almost perfect) Wwww-aaaa-leee...
Wall-E nearly melts.
She says his name so beautifully.
Moves closer.
EVE Wall-E.

Wall-E tries to repeat it: WALL-E Eeee...? EVE (slower) Eve.
15.
WALL-E Eeeaaah? EVE Eeeve.
Eeeve.
WALL-E Eee--vah! She giggles again.
Wall-E likes making her giggle.
WALL-E Eee-vah! Ee -- EVE Eve.
The wind kicks up.
The WARNING LIGHT sounds on Wall-E's chest.
He moves to grab her.
WALL-E (Gasp!) Eee-vah! EVE (hums) [Hey watch it! Don't come any closer!] She draws her gun on him.
Doesn't understand the danger.
The sandstorm rushes up behind her.
Too late.
Wall-E collapses into a box.
The storm hits full force.
Eve is instantly lost, disoriented.
EVE Wall-E? Wall-E? WALL-E'S HAND appears out of the dust.
Calmly takes Eve's hand.

His racks of oddities painted in colored light.
16.
An air of enchantment.
Eve is taken aback.
WALL-E (beeps) [Come on in.] She drifts through the sea of knickknacks.
Becomes spooked by a SINGING BILLY BASS FISH.
Threatens to shoot it, but Wall-E calms her down.
He is compelled to show her everything.
Hands her an eggbeater...
...bubble wrap (so infectious to pop)...
...a lightbulb (lights when she holds it)...
...the Rubik's Cube (she solves it immediately)...
...his Hello Dolly tape.
Curious, she begins unspooling the tape.
WALL-E (loud beeps) [My tape!!] He grabs it back.
Protective.
Inserts it carefully into the VCR.
Please still work.
The movie eventually appears on the TV.
Plays a clip of POYSC.
Wall-E is relieved.

Moving closer.
The mountains are piles of TRASH.
The entire surface is nothing but waste.

Something catches his eye.
Tugs on a piece of metal stuck in the stack.
A hubcap.
The sun reflects off it.
Wall-E checks the sky.
ON TRASH HEAP HORIZON The sun sets through the smoggy haze.
"...And we won't come back until we've kissed a girl --" He places the hubcap in his compactor.
Presses a button on his chest.
The song stops playing.
The end of a work day.

Whistles for his pet COCKROACH.
The insect hops on his shoulder.

Traverses miles of desolate waste.
Oblivious to roving storms of toxic weather.
Passes haunting structures buried within the trash.

Pretends the hubcap is a hat.
Continues to unpack: A spork.
A Rubik's Cube (unsolved).
A Zippo Lighter.
He presses a BUTTON by the rack of shelves.
They rotate until an empty space appears.
His new items are lovingly added to the shelf.
The Zippo joins a pre-existing LIGHTER COLLECTION.
A new song, It Only Takes A Moment, plays on the video.
Wall-E is drawn to it.

Wall-E creeps up to her.
Opens his arms wide...
...and measures her.
Turns to a pile of trash.
Splits open his eyes.
Begins welding something...
DISSOLVE TO: EXT.
BNL REFINERY - NEXT MORNING Eve powers up again.
Does a double take.
A TRASH SCULPTURE OF EVE stands in front of her.
She hovers away, unimpressed.
Doesn't notice Wall-E hiding behind a PILE OF PIPES.
Wall-E kicks the pipes in frustration.
They roll on top of him.
SONG ENDS MONTAGE OF EVE SEARCHING - Scans a car engine.

EXT.
DERELICT SHIPYARD - DUSK Eve hovers over the freighter.
Frustrated.
Not finding what she's looking for.
Wall-E eavesdrops from afar.
Eve flies past the ship's CRANE MAGNET.
Gets stuck.
Wrestles to free herself.
Furious, she BLOWS UP THE ENTIRE SHIP.
The reaction startles Wall-E.
Eve slumps down against a dredged anchor.
She gives up.
Concerned, Wall-E cautiously approaches.
Sits at the other end of the anchor.
Both robots stare silently at the fiery wreck.
Then...
...slowly, very slowly, Wall-E inches towards her.
Musters the courage to speak, when -- She suddenly turns to him: EVE (hums) [So what's your story?] Wall-E falls backwards with surprise.
Me? Eve scrolls through a variety of languages: EVE (German) [Directive?] (Japanese) [Directive?] WALL-E [Huh?] EVE (Swahili) [Directive?] (English) Directive? WALL-E (beeps) [Oh, I understand that!] 14.
EVE Directive? Wall-E eagerly turns to some nearby trash.
Scoops it into his compactor.
Proudly spits out a cube.
Points to Eve.
WALL-E (struggles to speak) Di...rec...t-- EVE Directive? Wall-E nods.
EVE Classified.
WALL-E (beeps) [Oh.
Sorry.] She scans his CHEST LOGO.
EVE Name? WALL-E (struggles again) W-wally? ...Wall-E.
EVE (smooth; almost perfect) Wwww-aaaa-leee...
Wall-E nearly melts.
She says his name so beautifully.
Moves closer.
EVE Wall-E.
(giggles) Eve.
Wall-E tries to repeat it: WALL-E Eeee...? EVE (slower) Eve.
15.
WALL-E Eeeaaah? EVE Eeeve.
Eeeve.
WALL-E Eee--vah! She giggles again.
Wall-E likes making her giggle.
WALL-E Eee-vah! Ee -- EVE Eve.
The wind kicks up.
The WARNING LIGHT sounds on Wall-E's chest.
He moves to grab her.
WALL-E (Gasp!) Eee-vah! EVE (hums) [Hey watch it! Don't come any closer!] She draws her gun on him.
Doesn't understand the danger.
The sandstorm rushes up behind her.
Too late.
Wall-E collapses into a box.
The storm hits full force.
Eve is instantly lost, disoriented.
EVE Wall-E? Wall-E? WALL-E'S HAND appears out of the dust.
Calmly takes Eve's hand.
INT.
TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER The back door lowers.
A rush of wind and sand.
Wall-E pulls Eve inside.
Closes the door.
She coughs up dust.
Wall-E hits a switch...
Strings of CHRISTMAS LIGHTS fill the space.
His racks of oddities painted in colored light.
16.
An air of enchantment.
Eve is taken aback.
WALL-E (beeps) [Come on in.] She drifts through the sea of knickknacks.
Becomes spooked by a SINGING BILLY BASS FISH.
Threatens to shoot it, but Wall-E calms her down.
He is compelled to show her everything.
Hands her an eggbeater...
...bubble wrap (so infectious to pop)...
...a lightbulb (lights when she holds it)...
...the Rubik's Cube (she solves it immediately)...
...his Hello Dolly tape.
Curious, she begins unspooling the tape.
WALL-E (loud beeps) [My tape!!] He grabs it back.
Protective.
Inserts it carefully into the VCR.
Please still work.
The movie eventually appears on the TV.
Plays a clip of POYSC.
Wall-E is relieved.
EXT.
SPACE FADE IN: Stars.
The upbeat show tune, Put On Your Sunday Clothes, plays.
"Out there, there's a world outside of Yonkers..." More stars.
Distant galaxies, constellations, nebulas...
A single planet.
Drab and brown.
Moving towards it.
Pushing through its polluted atmosphere.
"...Close your eyes and see it glisten..." EXT.
PLANET'S SURFACE - CONTINUOUS A range of mountains takes form in the haze.
Moving closer.
The mountains are piles of TRASH.
The entire surface is nothing but waste.
"...We're gonna find adventure in the evening air..." A silhouetted city in the distance.
What looks like skyscrapers turns into trash.
Thousands of neatly stacked CUBES OF TRASH, stories high.
Rows and rows of stacked cubes, like city avenues.
They go on for miles.
EXT.
AVENUE OF TRASH "...Beneath your parasol the world is all a smile..." Something moving on the ground far below.
A figure at the foot of a trash heap.
A SMALL SERVICE ROBOT diligently cubing trash.
Rusted, ancient.
Cute.
Every inch of him engineered for trash compacting.
Mini-shovel hands collect junk.
Scoop it into his open chassis.
His front plate closes slowly, compressing waste.
A faded label on his corroded chest plate: "Waste Allocation Loader - Earth Class" (WALL-E) Wall-E spits out a cube of trash.
Stacks it with the others.
2.
Something catches his eye.
Tugs on a piece of metal stuck in the stack.
A hubcap.
The sun reflects off it.
Wall-E checks the sky.
ON TRASH HEAP HORIZON The sun sets through the smoggy haze.
"...And we won't come back until we've kissed a girl --" He places the hubcap in his compactor.
Presses a button on his chest.
The song stops playing.
The end of a work day.
Wall-E attaches a lunch cooler to his back.
Whistles for his pet COCKROACH.
The insect hops on his shoulder.
They motor down from the top of a GIANT TRASH TOWER.
EXT.
AVENUES OF TRASH - DUSK Wall-E travels alone.
Traverses miles of desolate waste.
Oblivious to roving storms of toxic weather.
Passes haunting structures buried within the trash.
Buildings, highways, entire cities...
Everything branded with the SAME COMPANY LOGO.
"Buy N Large" "BNL" stores, restaurants, banks...transportation! The corporation ran every aspect of life.
There's even a BNL LOGO on Wall-E's chest plate.
CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER Wall-E drives over.
Headline: "TOO MUCH TRASH!! Earth Covered!!" The deck: "BNL CEO Declares Global Emergency!" A photo of the BNL CEO giving a weak smile.
Wall-E's old treads are threadbare.
Practically falling apart.
Cause a bumpy ride for his cockroach.
He passes the remains of other RUSTED WALL-E UNITS.
Fancies one with NEWER TREADS than his own...
EXT.
DESERTED STREET - MOMENTS LATER Wall-E now sports the newer treads.
Rolls past a SERIES OF HOLOGRAPHIC BILLBOARDS.
The solar-powered ads still activate when he passes them.
3.
BILLBOARD ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (Ad #1: BNL logo over trash) Too much garbage in your face? (Ad #2: starliner in space) There's plenty of space out in space! (Ad #3: starliners take off from Earth) BNL starliners leaving each day.
(Ad #4: WALL-E units wave goodbye) We'll clean up the mess while you're away.
EXT.
EDGE OF THE CITY Wall-E drives down a deserted overpass.
Activates an even LARGER HOLOGRAPHIC BILLBOARD.
CLOSE ON BILLBOARD AD Shows off a CITY-SIZED LUXURY STARLINER.
Depicts passengers enjoying all its amenities.
BILLBOARD ANNOUNCER (V.O.) The jewel of the BNL fleet: "The Axiom".
Spend your five year cruise in style.

And with our all-access hover chairs, even Grandma can join the fun! There's no need to walk! "The Axiom".
Putting the "star" in Executive Starliner.
The BNL CEO appears at the end.
Waves goodbye as the Axiom takes off.
BUY N LARGE CEO Because, at BNL, space is the final "fun"- tier.
The holographic billboard powers off.
Reveals the AXIOM'S DESERTED LAUNCHPAD in the distance.
The mammoth structure sits across the bay.
Now empty and dry.
A polluted, dead valley.
ON COLLAPSED BRIDGE RAMP Near its edge rests a WALL-E UNIT TRANSPORT TRUCK.
A giant child's Tonka Truck left to weather the elements.
A "Buy N Large" logo on its side.
Wall-E approaches the rear of the truck.
4.
Pulls on a lever.
The back lowers.
Wall-E motors up the ramp.
INT.
TRUCK - CONTINUOUS Open racks for storing WALL-Es line both walls.
KNICKKNACKS OF FOUND JUNK littered everywhere.
The tired robot removes his newfound treads.
Ahh...
Home.
Wall-E motors down the center aisle.
Flicks on an ancient BETAMAX PLAYER.
Jury-rigged to an iPod.
Pushes in a cassette labeled, "Hello Dolly!" The image is very poor quality.
Actors sing and dance to Put On Your Sunday Clothes (POYSC).
The same song Wall-E worked to.
WALL-E [Hums POYSC] Wall-E opens his cooler.
Newfound knickknacks.
Pulls out the hubcap from his chest.
Looks back at the TV.
Mimics the dancers on the screen.
Pretends the hubcap is a hat.
Continues to unpack: A spork.
A Rubik's Cube (unsolved).
A Zippo Lighter.
He presses a BUTTON by the rack of shelves.
They rotate until an empty space appears.
His new items are lovingly added to the shelf.
The Zippo joins a pre-existing LIGHTER COLLECTION.
A new song, It Only Takes A Moment, plays on the video.
Wall-E is drawn to it.
Presses his "Record" button.
ON TV SCREEN Two lovers sing gently to one another.
They kiss...hold hands...
Wall-E tilts his head as he watches.
Curious.
Holds his own hands.
5.
EXT.
TRUCK - NIGHT Wall-E motors outside.
Turns over his Igloo cooler to clean it out.
Pauses to take in the night sky.
STARS struggle to be seen through the polluted haze.
Wall-E presses the "Play" button on his chest.
The newly sampled It Only Takes A Moment (IOTAM) plays.
The wind picks up.
A WARNING LIGHT sounds on Wall-E's chest.
He looks out into the night.
A RAGING SANDSTORM approaches off the bay...
Unfazed, Wall-E heads back in the truck.
IOTAM still gently playing.
...The massive wave of sand roars closer...
Wall-E raises the door.
Pauses.
WHISTLES for his cockroach to come inside.
The door shuts just as the storm hits.
Obliterates everything in view.
INT.
TRUCK - SAME Wall-E alone in the center of his shelter.
Unwraps a BNL SPONGECAKE (think Twinkie).
Lays it out for the cockroach to sleep in.
It happily dives in.
Wall-E collapses himself into a storable cube.
Backs into an empty shelf space.
Rocks it like a cradle...
...and shuts down for the night.
Outside the wind howls like the Hounds of Hell.
INT.
WALL-E'S TRUCK - NEXT MORNING Wall-E's CHARGE METER flashes "WARNING".
He wakes.
Unboxes.
Groggy and lifeless.
Stumbles outside.
EXT.
ROOF OF WALL-E'S TRUCK The morning sun.
Wall-E fully exposed in its light.
His front panel splayed out like a tanning shield.
A solar collector.
